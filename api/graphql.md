# GRAPHQL

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues. It was developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.

## What are the core components of GraphQL?

1.  Schema: Defines the structure and types of data available.
2.  Query: Used to fetch data (equivalent to GET in REST).
3.  Mutation: Used to modify data (Create, Update, Delete).

4.  Subscription: Provides real-time updates.
5.  Resolver: Functions that fetch the actual data for the queries and mutations. ---

## How is GraphQL different from REST?

| Feature        | GraphQL                         | REST                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data Fetching  | Request specific fields         | Fetch entire resources    |
| Over-fetching  | No (only requested fields)      | Yes (fixed endpoint data) |
| Under-fetching | No (nested queries allowed)     | Yes (multiple requests)   |
| Versioning     | Not required                    | Requires new endpoints    |
| Performance    | Single request for complex data | Multiple round-trips      |

## What is a GraphQL schema?

    A GraphQL schema is a blueprint that defines the types of data and operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions) supported by the API.  Example schema:

    ```graphql type User {   id: ID!   name: String!   email: String! }  type Query {   getUser(id: ID!): User }  type Mutation {   createUser(name: String!, email: String!): User }`

## what is a GraphQL query?

A query is used to fetch data from the server.

Example query:

graphql

CopyEdit

`query {   getUser(id: "1") {     name     email   } }`

## What is a GraphQL mutation?

A mutation is used to modify data on the server (create, update, delete).

Example mutation:

graphql

CopyEdit

`mutation {   createUser(name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com") {     id     name   } }`

## What is a GraphQL subscription?

A subscription allows clients to receive real-time updates.

Example subscription:

graphql

CopyEdit

`subscription {   userAdded {     id     name   } }`

## What is a resolver in GraphQL?

Resolvers are functions that handle the logic behind GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

Example resolver:

javascript

CopyEdit

`const resolvers = {   Query: {     getUser: (_, { id }) => getUserById(id),   },   Mutation: {     createUser: (_, { name, email }) => createUser(name, email),   }, };`

## What are GraphQL variables and why are they useful?

Variables make queries dynamic and reusable.

Example query with variables:

graphql

CopyEdit

`query GetUser($id: ID!) {   getUser(id: $id) {     name     email   } }`

Passing variables:

json

CopyEdit

`{   "id": "1" }`

---

## What is a GraphQL fragment?

A fragment allows you to reuse fields in multiple queries.

Example fragment:

graphql

CopyEdit

`fragment UserFields on User {   id   name   email }  query {   getUser(id: "1") {     ...UserFields   } }`

## How does GraphQL handle errors?

GraphQL returns errors alongside a `data` field.

Example error response:

json

CopyEdit

`{   "data": null,   "errors": [     {       "message": "User not found",       "locations": [{ "line": 2, "column": 3 }],       "path": ["getUser"]     }   ] }`

## What are the benefits of using GraphQL?

- Efficient Data Fetching: Clients request exactly the fields they need.
- Strongly Typed Schema: Enforces a contract between client and server.
- Single Endpoint: Access all resources through a single endpoint.
- Reduced Over-fetching/Under-fetching: Flexible queries prevent these issues.
- Real-time Updates: Via subscriptions for event-driven data.

## What are the drawbacks of GraphQL?

- Complexity: More setup and learning curve than REST.
- Caching Challenges: Difficult to cache responses compared to REST.
- Performance Overhead: Parsing and resolving dynamic queries may be slower.
- Security Risks: Requires limiting query depth to avoid denial-of-service attacks.

## What is introspection in GraphQL?

Introspection allows clients to query the schema itself and retrieve metadata.

Example introspection query:

`{   __schema {     types {       name       fields {         name       }     }   } }`

## What are some best practices for designing GraphQL APIs?

1. Schema Design: Keep the schema simple and modular.
2. Pagination: Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets.
3. Security: Limit query depth and rate-limit requests.
4. Batching: Use DataLoader for optimizing N+1 query problems.
5. Error Handling: Provide clear and consistent error responses.
6. Caching: Use persisted queries or cache at the resolver level.

## How do you implement authentication and authorization in GraphQL?

- Authentication: Use tokens (e.g., JWT) to verify users.
- Authorization: Check user roles in resolvers before returning data.

Example context for authorization:

`const server = new ApolloServer({   typeDefs,   resolvers,   context: ({ req }) => {     const token = req.headers.authorization || "";     const user = verifyToken(token);     return { user };   }, });`

## What are Apollo Client and Apollo Server?

- Apollo Client: A state management library for consuming GraphQL APIs.
- Apollo Server: A GraphQL server implementation supporting queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## How do you handle pagination in GraphQL?

Implement cursor-based pagination using `startCursor`, `endCursor`, and `hasNextPage`.

Example schema:

`type UserConnection {   edges: [UserEdge]   pageInfo: PageInfo }  type UserEdge {   cursor: String   node: User }  type PageInfo {   hasNextPage: Boolean   endCursor: String }`

## What are some common GraphQL tools and libraries?

1. Apollo Server/Client: Comprehensive GraphQL solution.
2. GraphQL.js: Core reference implementation.
3. GraphQL Code Generator: Generates TypeScript types from schema.
4. Hasura: Auto-generates GraphQL over databases.

## What is schema stitching and federation?

- Schema Stitching: Combines multiple GraphQL schemas into a single schema.
- Federation: Distributes a GraphQL schema across multiple services while presenting a unified API.
